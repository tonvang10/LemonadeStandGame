1. Single Responsibility Principle.
- Here, I made sure each function did what it was suppose to do.

        public void ShowLemonStock()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("You have {0} lemons.", lemons.Count);
        }
        public void ShowSugarStock()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("You have {0} sugar cubes.", sugarCubes.Count);
        }
        public void ShowIceStock()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("You have {0} ice cubes.", iceCubes.Count);
        }
        public void ShowWaterStock()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("You have {0} gallons of water.", gallonsOfWater.Count);
        }
        public void ShowCupStock()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("You have {0} cups.\n", cups.Count);
        }

2. Open/Close Principle.
- Here, is an easy adjustment of how much money a player starts with.

    class Money
    {
        decimal money = 20.00M;

        public decimal GetMoney()
        {
            return money;
        }
    }
